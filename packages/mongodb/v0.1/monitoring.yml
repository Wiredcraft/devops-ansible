# TODO
#
# Define which database we want to enable monitoring for
#
# We may have to create / add a user for every single database
# existing on the server. 
# Meaning; we need to know / manage the databases names and loop
# through them to have an updated collectd plugin setup
#
# Sample config:
#  https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:MongoDB
