Amazon EC2 is a full featured cloud provider with extensive options.

*Due to the various types of instances, AMIs and locations, no default image AMI
can be provided by the devo.ps platform.*

Refer to the [Amazon EC2 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) 
in order to find the proper combinaison between:

- instance type, 
- ami, 
- location

Currently devo.ps __only support Ubuntu 14.04 LTS__, you should limit your AMI choices
to the [official Ubuntu AMIs](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.1/release/)
